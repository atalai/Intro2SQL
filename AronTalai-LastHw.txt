Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562 using "business_id"
iii. Category = 2643 using "business_id"
iv. Attribute = 1115 using "business_id"
v. Review = 8090 using "business_id" or 9581 using "user_id" or 10000 using "id"
vi. Checkin = 493 using "business_id"
vii. Photo = 6493 using "business_id" or 10000 using "id"
viii. Tip = 537 using "user_id" or 3979 using "business_id"
ix. User = 10000 using "id" 
x. Friend = 11 using "user_id"
xi. Elite_years = 2780 using "user_id"

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

6. Find the distribution of star ratings to the business in the following cities:

i. Avon

SQL code used to arrive at answer:

select stars, count(stars) as star_distribution
from business where city="Avon"
group by stars

Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns – star rating and count):

+-------+-------------------+
| stars | star_distribution |
+-------+-------------------+
|   1.5 |                 1 |
|   2.5 |                 2 |
|   3.5 |                 3 |
|   4.0 |                 2 |
|   4.5 |                 1 |
|   5.0 |                 1 |
+-------+-------------------+


ii. Beachwood

SQL code used to arrive at answer:

select stars, count(stars) as star_distribution
from business where city="Beachwood"
group by stars

Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns – star rating and count):

+-------+-------------------+
| stars | star_distribution |
+-------+-------------------+
|   2.0 |                 1 |
|   2.5 |                 1 |
|   3.0 |                 2 |
|   3.5 |                 2 |
|   4.0 |                 1 |
|   4.5 |                 2 |
|   5.0 |                 5 |
+-------+-------------------+		


7. Find the top 3 users based on their total number of reviews:
		
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	select name,review_count
	from user
	order by review_count desc limit 3
	
		
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
	+--------+--------------+
	| name   | review_count |
	+--------+--------------+
	| Gerald |         2000 |
	| Sara   |         1629 |
	| Yuri   |         1339 |
	+--------+--------------+
		


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

	Define: Correlation Measures the degree of linear relationship between two variables.If one variable tends to increase as the other decreases, the correlation coefficient is negative. Conversely, if the two variables tend to increase together the correlation coefficient is positive.

	based on the definition we run an SQL code to detect if more reviews correlates with more fans:

	select name,review_count,fans
	from user
	order by review_count desc limit 10 

	The results show this table:

	+-----------+--------------+------+
	| name      | review_count | fans |
	+-----------+--------------+------+
	| Gerald    |         2000 |  253 |
	| Sara      |         1629 |   50 |
	| Yuri      |         1339 |   76 |
	| .Hon      |         1246 |  101 |
	| William   |         1215 |  126 |
	| Harald    |         1153 |  311 |
	| eric      |         1116 |   16 |
	| Roanna    |         1039 |  104 |
	| Mimi      |          968 |  497 |
	| Christine |          930 |  173 |
	+-----------+--------------+------+

	Clearly, while Sara has more reviews than Yuri, yet she still has a lower 
	number of fans compared to Yuri. Obvoiusly, there is no correlation between
	posing more reviews with more fans.

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: yes

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	select (select count(text)
	from review
	where text like "%love%") as  num_of_reviews_with_love_in_it,

	(select count(text) 
	from review
	where text like "%hate%") as num_of_reviews_with_hate_in_it

	Results:
	+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
	| num_of_reviews_with_love_in_it | num_of_reviews_with_hate_in_it |
	+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
	|                           1780 |                            232 |
	+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+

	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	select name,fans
	from user
	order by fans desc limit 10
	
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
	+-----------+------+
	| name      | fans |
	+-----------+------+
	| Amy       |  503 |
	| Mimi      |  497 |
	| Harald    |  311 |
	| Gerald    |  253 |
	| Christine |  173 |
	| Lisa      |  159 |
	| Cat       |  133 |
	| William   |  126 |
	| Fran      |  124 |
	| Lissa     |  120 |
	+-----------+------+


	
	
11. Is there a strong relationship (or correlation) between having a high number of fans and being listed as "useful" or "funny?" Out of the top 10 users with the highest number of fans, what percent are also listed as “useful” or “funny”?

Key:
0% - 25% - Low relationship
26% - 75% - Medium relationship
76% - 100% - Strong relationship
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	select name,fans,useful,funny
	from user
	order by fans desc, useful desc, funny desc limit 10
	
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

	+-----------+------+--------+--------+
	| name      | fans | useful |  funny |
	+-----------+------+--------+--------+
	| Amy       |  503 |   3226 |   2554 |
	| Mimi      |  497 |    257 |    138 |
	| Harald    |  311 | 122921 | 122419 |
	| Gerald    |  253 |  17524 |   2324 |
	| Christine |  173 |   4834 |   6646 |
	| Lisa      |  159 |     48 |     13 |
	| Cat       |  133 |   1062 |    672 |
	| William   |  126 |   9363 |   9361 |
	| Fran      |  124 |   9851 |   7606 |
	| Lissa     |  120 |    455 |    150 |
	+-----------+------+--------+--------+
	
	
	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

	Based on this: https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science/peer/lBaEP/data-scientist-role-play-profiling-and-analyzing-the-yelp-dataset/discussions/threads/xkgEEGHqEeiEphLB3FeC3g

	The instructors only want to see an "informal" corrolation and not to use any sql packages.
	Clearly, Lisa has more fans than Cat, but she still has a lower 
	number of useful and funny comments compared to Cat. However, there is a low correlation between number of fans and useful and funny comments.

	100% of the top 100 have funny and useful comments as evident from the table above.
	
	
	

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code. 

Please note in i,ii, and iii I have the following definitions:
I have picked Richmond Hill as my city
Define groups: businesses with 2-3 stars --> low_star
			   businesses with 4-5 stars --> high_star
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

Yes the two groups I chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours. Please see below:

Define distribution of hours: Count(hours) for each store with either low/high star ratings.

Distribution of hours for the low_star group is as follows:

select city,count(hours) as hour_distribution_of_low_star
from business,hours where city="Richmond Hill"and stars>=2 and stars<=3

+---------------+-------------------------------+
| city          | hour_distribution_of_low_star |
+---------------+-------------------------------+
| Richmond Hill |                        290000 |
+---------------+-------------------------------+

Distribution of hours for the high_star group is as follows:

select city,count(hours) as hour_distribution_of_high_star
from business,hours where city="Richmond Hill"and stars>=4 and stars<=5

+---------------+--------------------------------+
| city          | hour_distribution_of_high_star |
+---------------+--------------------------------+
| Richmond Hill |                         110000 |
+---------------+--------------------------------+



ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

Yes the two groups I chose to analyze have a different number of reviews. Please see below:

If we add the total number of low_star reviews we will get:

select city,sum (review_count) as total_reviews_per_low_star
from business where city="Richmond Hill"  and stars>=2 and stars<=3

+---------------+----------------------------+
| city          | total_reviews_per_low_star |
+---------------+----------------------------+
| Richmond Hill |                        369 |
+---------------+----------------------------+


Now if we add the total number of high_star reviews we will get:

select city,sum (review_count) as total_reviews_per_high_star
from business where city="Richmond Hill"  and stars>=4 and stars<=5

+---------------+-----------------------------+
| city          | total_reviews_per_high_star |
+---------------+-----------------------------+
| Richmond Hill |                         136 |
+---------------+-----------------------------+
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

Yes. Before I explain please view the following logic. I have calculated the avg latitude and logitude
coordinates for the low_star and high_star group using the folloing sql code:


select city,Avg(latitude),Avg(longitude) --low_star
from business,hours where city="Richmond Hill"and stars>=2 and stars<=3
union
select city,Avg(latitude),Avg(longitude) --high_star
from business,hours where city="Richmond Hill"and stars>=4 and stars<=5

+---------------+---------------+----------------+
| city          | Avg(latitude) | Avg(longitude) |
+---------------+---------------+----------------+
| Richmond Hill | 43.8564000001 | -79.4003909092 |
| Richmond Hill | 43.8670137931 |       -79.4184 |
+---------------+---------------+----------------+

where the first row indicates low_star and the second row shows high_star businesses 

Clearly based on the average latitude and longitude in each group, it seems that high_star 
businesses are located in a geographically higher location and to the left of low_star businesses.

The grader is encouraged to ckeck the coordinates via this website to confirm the above explanation. 
https://www.latlong.net/Show-Latitude-Longitude.html

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.

Once again, I have picked Richmond Hill as my city. First let's see how many stores in Richmond Hill are open
or closed. I use this code: 

select count(name) as total_num_of_stores,sum(is_open) as num_of_open_stores,
(count(name)-sum(is_open)) as num_of_closed_stores
from business where city="Richmond Hill"

+---------------------+--------------------+----------------------+
| total_num_of_stores | num_of_open_stores | num_of_closed_stores |
+---------------------+--------------------+----------------------+
|                  54 |                 42 |                   12 |
+---------------------+--------------------+----------------------+

So right here we see that the number of open stores in Richmond Hill are higher than number of closed stores.
Let's find some differences in star ratings and review count.
		
i. Difference 1:

Looking at star ratings between open and closed stores, the average star rating for the open stores is higher than 
closed stores by a small margin. Moreover, the overall star count is higher in open stores but that is to be expected considering that there are more open stores than closed stores 

select count(stars),avg(stars),sum(stars)
from business where city="Richmond Hill" and is_open=0
union
select count(stars),avg(stars),sum(stars)
from business where city="Richmond Hill" and is_open=1

+--------------+---------------+------------+
| count(stars) |    avg(stars) | sum(stars) |
+--------------+---------------+------------+
|           12 | 3.04166666667 |       36.5 |
|           42 | 3.19047619048 |      134.0 |
+--------------+---------------+------------+
where the first row indicates closed stores and the second row shows open stores. 

Similarly, we can see differences in the average number of reviews between the two groups. The average review count
for the open stores is higher than closed stores by a noticable margin 

select count(review_count),avg(review_count),sum(review_count)
from business where city="Richmond Hill" and is_open=0
union
select count(review_count),avg(review_count),sum(review_count)
from business where city="Richmond Hill" and is_open=1

+---------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
| count(review_count) | avg(review_count) | sum(review_count) |
+---------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
|                  12 |     12.1666666667 |               146 |
|                  42 |      13.380952381 |               562 |
+---------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
where the first row indicates closed stores and the second row shows open stores. 

                  
ii. Difference 2:

This time, I will do a little sentiment analysis on the two groups and count the number of times the words love and hate
were used with respect to open and closed stores based on the "tip" table.

select (select count(text)
from tip,business
where text like "%love%" and city="Richmond Hill" and is_open=0) as  num_of_texts_with_love_in_it,

(select count(text) 
from tip,business
where text like "%hate%" and city="Richmond Hill" and is_open=0) as num_of_texts_with_hate_in_it

union 

select (select count(text)
from tip,business
where text like "%love%" and city="Richmond Hill" and is_open=1) as  num_of_texts_with_love_in_it,

(select count(text) 
from tip,business
where text like "%hate%" and city="Richmond Hill" and is_open=1) as num_of_texts_with_hate_in_it


+------------------------------+------------------------------+
| num_of_texts_with_love_in_it | num_of_texts_with_hate_in_it |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+
|                         5448 |                          384 |
|                        19068 |                         1344 |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+
where the first row indicates closed stores and the second row shows open stores. 

It seems clear that open stores have recieved a high number of comments with the text "love" in it but relatively few
texts with "hate" in it. The otehr differences are rather self evident based on the table.        
         
         
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

I want to do a popularity analysis between Japanese and chinese food in the province of Ontario. All analysed stores will be open. Due to the popularity of both food types, I'm interested to observe the Asian food preference patterns in Ontario. 
                 
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

I will be using the business table to compare the number of reviews, and star ratings. I will be judging the popularity of a certain food type based on the number of average star count per category as well as total/average number of reviews. In terms of Japanese/chinese food stores popularity comparison, I chose this data set becuase I think it provides a general overview of how people from ontario consume their Asian food. 
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

Where the first row indicates chinese food and the second row indicates Japanese food

PART1)
+-------------------+---------------------------+-------------------------+
| number_of_reviews | average_number_of_reviews | total_number_of_reviews |
+-------------------+---------------------------+-------------------------+
|                11 |             51.3636363636 |                     565 |
|                16 |                   16.9375 |                     271 |
+-------------------+---------------------------+-------------------------+
PART2)
+-----------------+-------------------------+-----------------------+
| number_of_stars | average_number_of_stars | total_number_of_stars |

Based on the tables above, chinese stores have far more reviewvs on average compared to their Japanese counterparts. This might indicate Ontarian preference towards chinese food in general. Usually people tend to review food stores that they either disliked or really liked. Considering that the average star rating is also higher in chinese food 
stores, one can saftly assume that chinese food is indeed more popular that Japanaese food. Another insight that does re-enforce the previous claim is that as there are more Japanese food stores in Ontario and we also see a higher total number of stars with respect to Japanese food stores. Nevertheless, the average number of stars (average star rating) seems to be much lower than chinese food stores.

Interesting! It seems that in the province of Ontario, based on this YELP dataset, people favor chinese food stores over
Japanese ones and they are not afraid to make their thoughts known!
         
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

PART1)

select count(review_count) as number_of_reviews,avg(review_count) as average_number_of_reviews,sum(review_count) as total_number_of_reviews
from business where state ="ON" and name like "%Chin%" and is_open=1

union

select count(review_count) as number_of_reviews,avg(review_count) as average_number_of_reviews,sum(review_count) as total_number_of_reviews
from business where state ="ON" and name like "%Japan%" and is_open=1


PART2)

select count(stars) as number_of_stars,avg(stars) as average_number_of_stars,sum(stars) as total_number_of_stars
from business where state ="ON" and name like "%Chin%" and is_open=1

union

select count(stars) as number_of_stars,avg(stars) as average_number_of_stars,sum(stars) as total_number_of_stars
from business where state ="ON" and name like "%Japan%" and is_open=1




The output is rather convoluted and the analysis does not seem to produce the required elements for deriving a conclusion. I liked the code it self but maybe limit your analysis based on a few indicators for this course. good job.

No comments were seen for the very last part. This section desperately needed comments to make sense of the code. Not a good idea to submit in docx form as the course clearly states to use pdf. it took me a long time to check your code due to inconsistent indention.
